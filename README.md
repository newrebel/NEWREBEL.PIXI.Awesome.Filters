# NEWREBEL.PIXI.Awesome.Filters

I've created this repository to `force` myself ;-) making it easier and possible to start adding some awesome PIXI 4 Filters, based on <i>(custom)</i> GLSL-Fragment and vertex-shaders. Codes that I've created over the years. At the moment these kinds of filters don't seem to exist for PIXI as something like a simple integratable plugin. Also, on various forums I see people struggling width certain aspects regarding for example the (varying) vTextureCoord (uv) that can be off in Pixi4. You'd be amazed that it's possible to create 3D (mimic) filters in PIXI's 2D environment. And how usable the most outrages crazy (texture) effects can be. 

Think about this, test it! 
1. Play the song 'Africa' by Toto (lame) on a rather loud volume. Then, after 30 seconds stop it, LEAVE YOUR VOLUME AS IT IS!! Then play either a Linkin Park song or even better 'God Hates us all' by Slayer. 
2. Go buy a pair of jeans. But try to find one that's perfectly blue... The most expensive and trendy jeans are aged, damaged! 
3. Check out Fender strat guitars. Brand new ones - expensive ones are scrathed, aged, worn, damaged. And the real awesome players play on these kinds of guitars.

Even heard of the the word 'RELIC'?? 

Conclusion: 
For example: WHEN YOU MAKE A GLITH FILTER... IT HAS TO FEEL LIKE SLAYER, TRENDY JEANS, A RELIC FENDER STRAT...  And not like a polished lame effect straight out of something like Windows Moviemaker or Apple's Final Cut. It has to be real! 

Soon you will see what I mean by this, if you don't understand it.

I'm currently working on a webpage to demonstrate these filters. I'll add them here!
